This project focuses on predicting housing prices using a machine learning model trained on the Dragon dataset. By leveraging a pre-trained model, you can input various features related to properties, and the system provides accurate price predictions. The model, saved and loaded using joblib, showcases practical application in real estate analytics. It's a valuable example of how data science can be used to forecast market trends and assist in real estate decision-making.
